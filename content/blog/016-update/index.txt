Hello everyone, there has silently been a quick update to version 2.1.0. Or I suppose silent till now. If you navigate to your [Options](/panel/options) you’ll see an something fresh—**Edit your custom css**. Clicking this new option will expand to display CSS you can modify to tweak your design beyond the capabilities of the interface.

All of the values are made available to you with css variables, which you can always get back to by clicking **reset**. You can also use `calc`, which is handle for doing simple mathematic operations on variables such as `spacing`.

Hopefully this is useful for making more extreme customizations, and for finessing the type for those of you in the know.
