### functionality
- different entry types

## refactor
- design by isolating the pure functions for templates

## data
- hardly everything app class constructor and `use` plugin for database
- learn a set of tools, not a framework
- while dat is a good project to support, it isnâ€™t the right solution for hardly everything. rather, using level and having a very obvious data export option would make the most sense.
- start with the forked substack login, and extend and make pull requests to that as required.
