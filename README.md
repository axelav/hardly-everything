<h1 align="center">ðŸ•— hardly everything</h1>

Instead of following or subscribing to something, just add it to Hardly Everything! When you do, youâ€™ll set how often you want to see itâ€”maybe once a week, maybe once a month.

## features

- **amplify**: be reminded of the quiet things
- **suppress**: rate limit the loud things
- **prioritize**: use periods of rest with custom intervals
- **customize**: set your own colors and typography taste
- **ownership**: no database; only local-storage

## philosophy

Popular apps and sites often share a common element today; *the feed*. It looks like Facebookâ€™s timeline, or Buzzfeedâ€™s homepageâ€”an endlessly updating stream of content, designed to keep you returning, and spending more time.

**Hardly Everything** attempts to circumnavigate these corporate feeds by supplying you with an *anti-feed*. Your feed closely resembles those already familiarâ€”a scrolling list, at essence. You add things to this list, but when doing so prioritize their importance to you by defining a period of **rest**.

After clicking an entry, it disappears from your feed for the duration of itâ€™s rest. Your feed updates once per day, there is never something new until tomorrow, a natural cycle, shared by a period of another kind of rest.

Your entries can rest anywhere from a day to a year. Link to a page you like to revisit often, or a page you want to remember in a few months. Link to something once every year, to free you from the impulse, if youâ€™d like.

This tool is not a rejection of an interface, but a prompt to question who the interface serves, and why. It is also meant to be immediately useful, and hopefully you will find it that way, too.
