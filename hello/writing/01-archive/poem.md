you have a list
the list contains links
the links are visible

you click a link
your link opens
it dissapears from the list
the link is now hidden

you’ve clicked all your links
now none are visible



time passes
slowly your links re-appear
you told them to how long to dissapear for when you added them
some are more important than others so they appear more often
others, maybe not



your links are a feed
the feed is constructed on importance, not activity
loud things can’t be loud
quiet things don’t get forgotten
