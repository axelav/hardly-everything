hey everyone,

wanted to say thanks to all who applied to check out the beta. it’s still very much in beta, but i’m temporarily disabling the password to get started. not sure how long that will last for, but it seems like there haven’t been any catostrophic yet, so go for it.

a few thoughts based off conversations and feedback i’ve had with you all. i should specify, when i say “design”, i’m referencing “design thinking”, which includes graphic design, interaction design, programming, project management, etc…

- there is a need for opinionated tools—useful things which attempt to express meaning and understanding beyond their immediate utility to the individual “user”. one way of seeing this is as an extention of writing, or poetry, or other expressive output, typically of an individual author.

- there is a lack of public discourse surrounding interaction design, and who design serves, especially amongst designers.

- there is an imbalance of decisions made involving convenience and engagement, health and well being, etc…  it’s almost entirely skewed towards the former when placing the context outside the immediate intended use of the tool/service/whatever.

- this culture is perpetuated by the exagerated economics surrounding technology, the value of “users”, etc… designers literally can’t talk about this amongst themselves because of mountains of NDAs.

i’ve been reluctant to talk about this stuff, because it isn’t inherintely  attractive stuff, but i’ve felt an obligation to, which maybe i’ll get into at some point.
