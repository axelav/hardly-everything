  Hardly Everything was released into initial beta back in October of last year. For a few months I used it frequently, but that slowly began decreasing. There were a couple primary reasons for that:

  - The inability to easily edit entries after having visited them.
  - Not being able to hide an entry without visiting it.
  - The distraction of visiting multiple times a day, for reasons explained next…

  ### Rests

  The rest duration for an entry can now be set anywhere from one day to one year. Previously the minimum was one minute. The maximum was one-hundred years. Although the conceptual foundation remains intact, such drastic scale introduced usability issues. 

  Additionally, the interface now updates once per day, instead of updating live once every minute to see if any new entries have become visible.

  Both of these changes emphasize the daily cycle. Nothing you haven’t seen will appear until tomorrow, removing the impulse to check throughout the day to see if there is anything new.

  ### Interface

  - Overall navigation is clearer.
  - Removed the “edit mode”, which was somewhat confusing and consolidated too many options. Instead, each entry has a minimal UI which appears on hover, letting you make quick edits regardless of context.
  - Design options have been moved to a dedicated panel.
  - New typography options and inline font preview.
  - Color pickers to define custom background and text colors.

  ### Hosting environment

  The first version of Hardly Everything made use of Google’s Firebase. This was due to the ease of deployment, ssl configuration, and the possibility of using the very simple front-end js database API for future functionality.

  This dependency was removed, for a few reasons, including [some obvious](https://startupsventurecapital.com/firebase-costs-increased-by-7-000-81dc0a27271d) and note-so-obvious, which will be expanded upon in the future.

  The server is now managed with Digital Ocean, using a custom deployment process.

  ### Future improvements

  There are a few things planned. If you have any thoughts feel free to [send along](mailto:contact@jon-kyle.com).
