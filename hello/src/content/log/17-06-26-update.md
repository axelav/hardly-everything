  ### New features

  - **Tags** have been added, which enables a new level of specificity. This is useful for using Hardly Everything more as a traditional bookmarking tool, or if you are looking to create separate feeds.

  - Some additional **UI** adjustments, which will hopefully go unnoticed.

  ### Sync & Login

  There have been some questions about synchronizing your feeds between devices. This is at the top of the list. With this functionality come questions about data ownership. Although these are simple lists of links, there is still a lot of information to be had about someone through the meta-data.

  Because of this, additional time is being put into options which don’t require your data being stored exclusively by Hardly Everything. Data ownership is one of the important topics of our time—every little bit in the right direction helps.
