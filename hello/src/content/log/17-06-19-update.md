  - An early version of **Search** has been added. This is useful for when looking for a specific entry, especially in *all* view.
  
  - Added a new font option called [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral), the latest offering by [Production Type](https://www.productiontype.com/).

  - Updated entry navigation for hide/edit.

  - A few small updates with the UI which greatly improves performance. For example, to build the list of visible entries, several conditions were being checked on each render. Instead, that array is now created only when needed and stored in state.
