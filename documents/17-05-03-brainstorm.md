# hardly everything

some thoughts brainstorming w/ lily about directions. ended up circling back around to hardly everything as an outlet to not only apply ideas about topics i’m interested in, but also create a source of income to enable those explorations, all while commenting on why that is nessecarry, and what affordances are provided by the structuring of the project. or something.

## unfiltered

- gallery section ala tci weekends for commisions related to time, cadence and intervals.
- ad/free, $2/month sub hosted, $10/license for any version self hosted
- build centralized to start, with the plan to become decentralized/distributed, and use as a case study on how to do the transition. (how to migrate from firebase to the distributed web)
- write a “how to make hardly everything” series, promote choo
- slow growth, project size, sustainability and how value informs decisions.
- people’s general awareness that if you’re not paying for the product, you’re the product being sold
- sorting options (dismissed, resurfaced, added)
- instead of just links, you create “cards”
- a card can be text, an image, a video, or mp3.
- it can have a link
- import channel / block from arena option
- instead of edit mode, when hovering over a link/card you can hit edit
- only view all toggle and add in nav
- /api instead of /db

## current version

### bad
- you can only dismiss a site by clicking it
- if you haven’t visited in a while, you’ll see a ton of links
- only text

### good
- customizability
- simplicity

## app

### intervals
- intervals range from a day up to a year. perhaps there is a setting which lets this be more extreme.
- this is aligned with thoughts on intervals and cycles. the 24 hour cycle being a “natural” cadence. (on kawara, etc) 
- this is good, because once a few links are shown in the morning, you know nothing else will appear that day.
- if you haven’t clicked a link, it will auto dismiss after a certain number of days (setting)

## monetization
