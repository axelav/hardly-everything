this project is a progression of three projects of mine from the past few years which exist in browser windows:

- asdf.cool
- a-line-moving-across-a-window-once-every-year.com
- bgcolor-fading-from-black-to-white-every-century.com

a-line-moving and bgcolor-fading are about time, while asdf.cool is about memory.

on the surface, a-line-moving and bgcolor-fading are conceptual pieces, while asdf is a functional tool, but really i think about them as the same. part of this is due to context—browser windows, another is by means of production—a single person.

- less about scheduling, more about intervals
- the utility of sculptural furniture, memphis, etc…
- growth and capital
- facebook, google, and twitter as being the big-box stores of the internet
- there is a need for more professionally produced niche projects, or a single persons’s interpritation of how something works.
- a call for more fully functional, specific-use niche projects
- tools and services which don’t have the primary objective of increasing the number of engagements, but serve a humanistic purpose.
