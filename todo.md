### refactor
before starting to revisit the project, some time was spent looking into using vue.js. while it is promising, and provides a number of affordances (a very solid build process, etc), it does require a pretty total rewrite, which would take too much time. instead, switching to using rooch, and cleaning up the existing codebase is likely time better spent.
